If you have an idea for a feature enhancement or a bug fix, we'd love to know! We handle issue tracking using GitHub's issue system, so please add your issue/comment there.

If you have a bug fix or adding functionality without affecting current API, you should target and branch off of `master`. This way, we're flexible to pull in bug fixes and additional features as soon as possible.
